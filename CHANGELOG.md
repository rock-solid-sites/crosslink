# Changelog

All notable changes to Crosslink will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `crosslink migrate hub-v3 --remigrate-from-v2` - regenerates the v3 genesis
  from the current `crosslink/hub` (v2) tip and force-pushes it, superseding a
  stale remote v3 hub. The discoverable recovery path when a v2-only binary
  kept writing after an earlier migration (forecast-bio/crosslink#653).

### Changed
- tracker_remote=fork verification (#795)

- `crosslink migrate hub-v3` now guards against silently adopting a **stale**
  remote v3 hub. Before adopting, it compares the remote's genesis against the
  live `crosslink/hub` (v2) tip; if v2 has advanced past the genesis, adoption
  is refused (with the issue/commit delta and the `--remigrate-from-v2`
  remedy) unless `--adopt-stale` is passed. `--finalize` applies the same check
  and refuses to delete the v2 branch while it is ahead of v3, so a stale adopt
  can never escalate to real data loss (forecast-bio/crosslink#653).

### Fixed
- Fix tracker_remote to writable fork remote so local-only issues survive sync (#794)

- `crosslink integrity` no longer false-FAILs `counters` and `hydration` on a
  v3 hub. Both checks read legacy v2 worktree artifacts (meta/counters.json,
  issues/*.json) that v3 never materializes, fabricating "next_display_id is
  1" and "0 issues in JSON, N in SQLite" against healthy hubs - and steering
  users toward a `--repair --accept-data-loss` that wiped local shared tables
  and restored nothing. On v3 the checks now compare against the reduced
  checkpoint state (the same source the already-v3-aware `locks` check uses),
  and hydration repair re-hydrates from that state instead of the empty
  worktree (gh#7).
- Hydration no longer multiplies hub comments. Comments have no unique uuid
  index, so a hub comment adopted into the sqlite-only preservation snapshot
  (via a numeric issue-id collision, e.g. after a legacy import) was restored
  next to the fresh copy each pass re-inserted - one extra byte-identical
  copy per mutating invocation. Comment hydration and the preservation
  restore now dedup by uuid, which also collapses previously accumulated
  duplicates back to a single copy on the next hydration. Refused v2
  mutations are additionally side-effect-free: the legacy-layout refusal now
  fires before the hub write lock is acquired (gh#12).
- `crosslink locks release` is no longer a silent no-op from a fresh process
  on a v3 hub. `read_lock_v2`'s v3 branch consulted only the in-process
  `last_v3_state` cache - empty in any process that had not yet performed a
  v3 mutation - so release reported "was not locked" while `locks list`
  (which reads the checkpoint) showed the claim. The v3 read now lazily
  reduces the persisted ref namespace when the cache is cold, the same idiom
  `load_milestone_by_id` already uses; this also repairs the `AlreadyHeld`
  pre-check in `claim_lock_v2` (gh#8).
- Claude hooks now resolve the crosslink binary via `find_crosslink_binary()`
  instead of a bare PATH lookup (`work-check.py` control-flags check,
  `heartbeat.py`, `session-start.py`), and `check_control_flags` fails open
  unless stdout parses as flag-state JSON with a blocking flag actually set.
  Previously, a PATH binary too old to know `agent flags` exited 2 with a clap
  usage error - the same exit code as the flags protocol - and every
  Write/Edit/Bash call was blocked with a false "AGENT PAUSED - an operator
  has paused this agent" message (gh#31).
- `crosslink migrate to-shared` now works on v3 hubs (gh#4, second half). The
  v2 body wrote worktree JSON and counters the reduction never reads, then
  pushed the nonexistent legacy `crosslink/hub` ref ("src refspec does not
  match any"). On v3 it now promotes SQLite-only issues (uuids the reduced
  state does not know) through the event log via the same batch path
  `import` uses - one commit, one hydration - preserving existing uuids (so
  hydration replaces local rows in place instead of duplicating them) and
  carrying free positive local ids into the reduction so local numbering
  survives. Idempotent: already-promoted issues are skipped, so it doubles
  as the recovery sweep for rows created before the hub was established.
- Post-migrate `crosslink sync` no longer aborts with SQLite `Error code
  1555: constraint failed` (gh#11). Preserved sqlite-only comments carry
  positive v2/import-era ids while hydration inserts hub comments at frozen
  positive display ids through a plain INSERT - a collision killed the whole
  hydration transaction. The preservation restore now re-keys colliding
  preserved comment ids to fresh negative local ids (comment ids are not FK
  targets), mirroring the issue-id remap above it.
- `crosslink create` / `quick` after a legacy `import` no longer silently lose
  the new issue while reporting success (#5, related #4). Three fixes:
  `crosslink import` on a v3 hub now promotes the whole batch through the
  event log in a single commit, so imported issues get reduction-assigned
  display ids and are hub-visible like created issues; hydration no longer
  lets a preserved local-only issue silently REPLACE (INSERT OR REPLACE) a hub
  issue occupying the same id — the local row is remapped to a negative local
  id with a warning and both survive; and `create` verifies the new issue is
  actually visible in `SQLite` after hydration, failing loudly instead of
  reporting a phantom id. Also starts v3 negative comment-id numbering below
  preserved comment ids (the v3 analogue of #681).
- `crosslink sync` / `crosslink init` no longer fail on Git < 2.42.0 (e.g.
  Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, which ships Git 2.34.1) with `unknown option 'orphan'`.
  Hub-v3 and knowledge cache setup used `git worktree add --orphan` (added in
  Git 2.42.0); on older Git they now fall back to an equivalent sequence
  (detached worktree + `git checkout --orphan` + clearing the tree) that yields
  the same empty unborn orphan branch (forecast-bio/crosslink#655).

## [0.9.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-13

> First beta of the 0.9 line. The 0.6.0-0.8.0 sections below were authored on
> their release branches and are reconciled into this shared history by this cut.

### Breaking

- **Hub v3: per-agent-ref coordination storage.** The shared `crosslink/hub`
  branch with mutable JSON state is replaced by single-writer git refs -
  visible branches `crosslink/agents/<id>`, `crosslink/checkpoint`,
  `crosslink/meta` - carrying append-only signed event logs reduced
  deterministically to materialized state. Pushes to your own ref are always
  fast-forward; the conflict can no longer occur, and ~10,000 lines of
  rebase-retry/recovery machinery were deleted outright (guarded by a
  permanent regression test). Mutations on un-migrated v2 hubs refuse with a
  migrate prompt; v2 hubs remain readable forever for inspection and
  migration. The checkpoint branch carries a browsable state tree (per-issue
  JSON with inline comments, README, milestones) and each agent's branch is
  its own visible activity/heartbeat feed.
- `crosslink serve` is deprecated in favor of `crosslink dashboard serve`.

### Added

- `crosslink migrate hub-v3` - verified one-shot migration (full-state gate
  with automatic rollback; idempotent re-run doubles as push retry), adoption
  path for machines whose remote was already migrated, `--finalize
  --yes-delete-v2` hard cutover (survives corrupt legacy worktree
  registrations), and `migrate hub-branches` for the hidden-refs-to-branches
  rename.
- Full event sourcing: every issue/milestone mutation emits a signed event;
  new event variants for comments, time entries, deletion tombstones,
  milestones, and schedule changes, with deterministic display-id assignment.
- Dashboard - multi-project control panel (`crosslink dashboard serve`):
  SCADA-style aggregation of every tracked project with live tiles, alerts
  (stale locks, silent agents, overdue issues), full write surface with audit
  trail, webhook alerting (Slack/Discord/JSON), CSV export, GitHub PAT
  management, filesystem autodiscovery, and a git-native agent control
  protocol (`crosslink agent request/poll-requests/requests`).
- Sentinel cpitd source: scheduled code-clone scans filing triage issues
  (`sentinel.sources.cpitd.*`, default off) - plus pipx-first cpitd install
  with actionable PEP 668 guidance (GH#621).
- `--contributor` attribution override on `knowledge add/edit/import`
  (GH#628).
- `argument-hint` frontmatter on all arg-taking command templates (GH#626).

### Fixed

- Hook blocking messages now reach the model: exit-2 messages write to
  stderr per the Claude Code hook contract (GH#624).
- Stray `.crosslink/` directories from cwd drift: hooks can no longer seed
  them and discovery refuses to bind them (GH#625).
- Kickoff pipeline `runs` records are reconciled on completion instead of
  accumulating stale `running` rows forever (GH#614).
- Hub-sync concurrency hardening: unique fsynced temp files, no live-holder
  lock stealing, unified worktree locking (#750); plumbing ref writes pinned
  immune to git signing config (GH#627).
- Hub-state recovery could rewrite a feature branch with hub contents when
  the cache worktree link broke (GH#574); corrupt-JSON-committed-over-good-
  history class eliminated by architecture (GH#616); unrelated-histories
  divergence error eliminated (GH#629).
- `/design` first-run zsh glob failure - fixed templates; refresh deployed
  copies with `crosslink init --force` (GH#615).

## [0.1.1-alpha.1] - 2026-02-26

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Distributed issue locking and agent coordination, ported from crosslink-enterprise.

#### Agent Identity
- `crosslink agent init <id>` — register a machine-local agent identity (stored in `.crosslink/agent.json`, gitignored)
- `crosslink agent status` — show agent identity and currently held locks

#### Distributed Locking
- `crosslink locks list` — show all active issue locks with stale detection
- `crosslink locks check <id>` — check if a specific issue is available or claimed
- `crosslink sync` — fetch lock state from the `crosslink/locks` coordination branch, verify GPG signatures, display cache path and commit info

#### Lock-Aware Workflows
- `crosslink next` now skips issues locked by other agents
- `crosslink session work <id>` enforces lock ownership before allowing work
- `crosslink create --work` and `crosslink subissue --work` check locks before claiming
- Session start records agent identity in the database (schema v8 to v9 migration)

#### Daemon Heartbeat
- Daemon pushes agent heartbeat every 2.5 minutes to the coordination branch
- Stale lock detection based on heartbeat freshness

#### Hook Enhancements
- `session-start.py` runs `crosslink sync` and displays active locks on startup
- `work-check.py` warns (in strict mode) when working on an issue locked by another agent

#### Init Improvements
- `crosslink init` now writes `.crosslink/.gitignore` to exclude machine-local files (`agent.json`, `.locks-cache/`)

### Claude 4.6 Opus Optimization Epic (#99)

Comprehensive overhaul to make crosslink work seamlessly with Claude 4.6 Opus,
